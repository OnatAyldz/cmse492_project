# Project Title: Handwritten Math Equation Solver
## 1. Project Overview
Brief Description: A neural network model designed to solve mathematical equations from photos by recognizing and interpreting symbols.
Project Goals: The project initially focuses on arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) and will expand to handle linear equations and more advanced mathematical functions such as summations, logarithms, and limits.
## 2. Features
- Stage 1: Recognize and solve basic arithmetic equations from images.
- Stage 2: Solve linear equations with a specified number of variables.
- Stage 3: Support complex mathematical functions including summations, logarithmic functions, and limits.
##3. Motivation
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying different sections of mathematical equations in images, providing a foundation for optical character recognition (OCR) with an emphasis on mathematical symbols.
##4. Technologies Used
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras (for neural network development), OpenCV (for image processing), NumPy, and others as needed for handling math functions and image preprocessing.
